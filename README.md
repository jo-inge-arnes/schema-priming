Prototype demonstrating the approach presented in the paper *Schema-Based Priming of Large Language Model for Data Object Validation
Compliance*, which is currently [available as a preprint](https://).

Note that the system message prompt has been altered to perform better on GPT-3.5 Turbo compared to message listed the preprint. This is one of the changes that will be made to the final version of the paper.
